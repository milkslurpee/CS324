# trace40.txt - Pipeline with two commands, both in the same process group

# ./myspin should take 5 seconds without interruption, but ./myintgroup should
# interrupt all processes in the process group in 1 second.  Thus, the entire
# pipeline should finish in 1 second.  If the timestamps resulting from
# /bin/date are more than 3 seconds apart, then we know that ./myspin didn't
# get the signal and thus, wasn't in the same process group.
