# trace38.txt - Pipeline with more than two commands
#

# The output of ./myppid is the PID in parentheses.  This first pipeline
# filters out all output; the first ./mygrep does not match, and the second
# ./mygrep does match.  Thus, ultimately there is no output to the console.
/bin/echo -e tsh> ./myppid \0174 ./mygrep 5 [a-z] \0174 ./mygrep 5 [0-9]
./myppid | ./mygrep 5 [a-z] | ./mygrep 5 [0-9]

# This second pipeline also filters out all output; the first ./mygrep matches,
# and the second ./mygrep does not match.  Thus, ultimately there is no output to
# the console.
/bin/echo -e tsh> ./myppid \0174 ./mygrep 5 [0-9] \0174 ./mygrep 5 [a-z]
./myppid | ./mygrep 5 [0-9] | ./mygrep 5 [a-z]

# This pipeline should again result in no output.  Although the middle ./mycat
# command simply passes the input through, the last ./mygrep uses a pattern
# that does not match the input.
/bin/echo -e tsh> ./myppid \0174 ./mycat 5 \0174 ./mygrep 5 [a-z]
./myppid | ./mycat 5 | ./mygrep 5 [a-z]

# This should be the same as the previous command, but there are now two
# ./mycat commands in the middle
/bin/echo -e tsh> ./myppid \0174 ./mycat 5 \0174  ./mycat 5 \0174 ./mygrep 5 [a-z]
./myppid | ./mycat 5 | ./mycat 5 | ./mygrep 5 [a-z]
# This pipeline should allow the PID to be printed by the last command because
# the middle ./mycat command simply passes the input through, and the last
# ./mygrep uses a matching pattern.
/bin/echo -e tsh> ./myppid \0174 ./mycat 5 \0174 ./mygrep 5 [0-9]
./myppid | ./mycat 5 |  ./mygrep 5 [0-9]

# This should be the same as the previous command, but there are now two
# ./mycat commands in the middle
/bin/echo -e tsh> ./myppid \0174 ./mycat 5 \0174 ./mycat 5 \0174 ./mygrep 5 [0-9]
./myppid | ./mycat 5 | ./mycat 5 | ./mygrep 5 [0-9]
