# The first instance of TEMPFILE1 creates that file with its content being the
# name of the file.  Thus, it exists when /bin/echo is called, and it is
# removed when /bin/rm is called.
/bin/echo -e tsh> /bin/rm TEMPFILE1
/bin/rm TEMPFILE1

# Since TEMPFILE1 has already been seen (in previous commands), it will not
# come into existence with the /bin/echo command.  Thus, at this point (because
# of the previous /bin/rm command), it will not exist until the pipeline below
# is run. The first instance of TEMPFILE2 creates that file with its content
# being the name of the file.  Thus, it exists when /bin/echo is called.
# The ./mycat command should read the contents of TEMPFILE2, for which stdin
# has been redirected and then print it to TEMPFILE1, to which stdout has been
# redirected.  Thus, there should be no output to the console.
/bin/echo -e tsh> ./mycat 5 \0074 TEMPFILE2 \0076 TEMPFILE1
./mycat 5 < TEMPFILE2 > TEMPFILE1

# Dump the contents of TEMPFILE1.
# If the contents of this file are incorrect, then either input redirection or
# output redirection did not work properly.
/bin/echo -e tsh> ./mycat 5 TEMPFILE1
./mycat 5 TEMPFILE1
