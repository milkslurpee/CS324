# The first instance of TEMPFILE1 and TEMPFILE2 creates those files with
# their content being the name of the files.  Thus, they exist when
# /bin/echo is called, and they are removed when /bin/rm is called.
/bin/echo -e tsh> /bin/rm TEMPFILE1 TEMPFILE2
/bin/rm TEMPFILE1 TEMPFILE2

# Since TEMPFILE1 has already been seen (in previous commands), it will not
# come into existence with the /bin/echo command.  Thus, at this point (because
# of the previous /bin/rm command), it will not exist until ./myppid is called.
# The ./myppid command should produce no output to the console because stdout
# has been redirected.
/bin/echo -e tsh> ./myppid \0076 TEMPFILE1
./myppid > TEMPFILE1

# Since TEMPFILE1 has already been seen (in previous commands), it will not
# come into existence with the /bin/echo command.  Thus, at this point (because
# of the previous /bin/rm command), it will not exist until ./myppid is called.
# The stderr output from ./myppid should be the only output to the console
# because stdout has been redirected, but stderr has not.
#
# NOTE: currently this doesn't seem to work...
/bin/echo -e tsh> ./myppid -e \0076 TEMPFILE2
./myppid -e > TEMPFILE2

# In this case TEMPFILE3 will be created when /bin/echo is called because it is
# the first time it has appeared in the file.  Thus, the file will exist, with
# contents being the name of the file itself, when ./myppid is called.
/bin/echo -e tsh> ./myppid \0076 TEMPFILE3
./myppid > TEMPFILE3

# Dump the contents of TEMPFILE1.
# If the contents of this file are incorrect, then it was either not opened
# properly (e.g., nonexistent file should be created) or not duplicated properly
# onto stdout.
/bin/echo -e tsh> ./mycat 5 TEMPFILE1
./mycat 5 TEMPFILE1

# Dump the contents of TEMPFILE2.
# If the contents of this file are incorrect, then it was either not opened
# properly (e.g., nonexistent file should be created), not duplicated properly
# onto stdout, or file was also duplicated onto stderr (it shouldn't be).
/bin/echo -e tsh> ./mycat 5 TEMPFILE2
./mycat 5 TEMPFILE2

# Dump the contents of TEMPFILE3.
# If the contents of this file are incorrect, then it was either not opened
# properly (e.g., existing file should be truncated) or not duplicated properly
# onto stdout.
/bin/echo -e tsh> ./mycat 5 TEMPFILE3
./mycat 5 TEMPFILE3
