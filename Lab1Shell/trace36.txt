# trace36.txt - Pipeline with two commands
#

# Start out easy.  Pipe the contents of ./myppid to ./mycat, which should just
# print them on the terminal. (Note, however, that it is ./mycat printing to
# the terminal, not ./myppid.)
/bin/echo -e tsh> ./myppid \0174 ./mycat 5
./myppid | ./mycat 5

# Now pipe the contents of ./myppid to grep, which should only print them if
# the pattern matches.  The first pattern should match (i.e., because it is a
# numerical process ID being printed), and the second pattern should not.

/bin/echo -e tsh> ./myppid \0174 ./mygrep 5 [0-9]
./myppid | ./mygrep 5 [0-9]

/bin/echo -e tsh> ./myppid \0174 ./mygrep 5 [a-z]
./myppid | ./mygrep 5 [a-z]
