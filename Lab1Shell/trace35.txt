# The first instance of TEMPFILE1 brings that file into existence with its
# content being the name of the file.  Thus, it is created when
# /bin/echo is called.  Then ./mycat reads the file and prints its contents to
# standard output.  The argument "5" tells ./mycat to quit after 5 seconds, no
# matter what, so the process doesn't linger.
/bin/echo -e tsh> ./mycat 5 \0074 TEMPFILE1
./mycat 5 < TEMPFILE1
